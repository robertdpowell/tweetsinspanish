30 days ago I had an idea. Having been thrown in the deep end, decided I needed a resource that would motivate me to commit commit myself to improving  practicing my Welsh every day, I decided

*How are we going to do this? Should we just focus on English for now? What happens when she goes back in September - will she have fallen behind? How are we going to help her?*

**This wasn't the plan!**


The school are doing a fantastic job of sending out resources to support her learning but even the most basic of books are a struggle for us to follow.


I realised that I needed to do something to accelerate my acquisition of the language.

#### TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT LEARNING RESOURCE

We have been trying our best to learn the language since she started at her school last September. We both work full time and as other parents will understand, finding the time to learn a new language is a real challenge. My wife prefers the more traditional and stuctured classroom based setting and enrolled in an evening class, whereas I have been relying on online services such as the excellent [Say Something in Welsh](https://www.saysomethingin.com/welsh) that I can consume when I get a spare 10 minutes during the day.


The problem with my approach of course is that **I** need to bring the discipline and structure, and with so many worklife/homelife distractions I found that I was sometimes going weeks without doing any Welsh at all....

<br>

####  CREATING MY OWN RESOURCE

I needed to find a routine and a resource that helped enforce a discipline of daily Welsh practice. Something that I could fit in to **15 minutes a day**. A resource that would give me a good return on investment. 

And that is where the idea for [Tweets In Welsh](https://tweetsinwelsh.com/) came from.

#### WHY TWEETS?

Tweets are a wonderful medium for learning a language.

1. They are short
2. They are very often written in 'everyday' language 
3. There are plenty of them (and they are cheap to source!)
4. They cover a wide variety of interests so there's something for everyone (music, sport, technology, the news..) 


So in an effort to improve my Welsh reading and vocabulary, I have committed to ***translating one tweet from Welsh to English every day.***

<br>

#### TWEETSINWELSH.COM

[tweetsinwelsh.com](https://tweetsinwelsh.com/) is where I am publishing this learning journey.

I'm sharing my learning journey online in the hope that doing so will keep me committed and disciplined **(2 weeks in now and still going strong!)**. But also, I hope that it adds some value for others who are learning the language.

A big thanks to everyone who has offered kind words of support for this little adventure so far.

Until next time!
